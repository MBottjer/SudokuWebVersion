This task was set whilst learning to code at Makers Academy. The aim was to build my first web app using Sinatra - a DSL for web services.

This application was deployed to heroku at: http://secure-brook-9434.herokuapp.com/

N.B. there are a number of improvements that could be made to support the stability of the application e.g. further integration tests and refactoring.
